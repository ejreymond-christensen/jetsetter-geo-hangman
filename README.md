# jetsetter-geo-hangman
Hangman game using javaScript


## Geography Hangman

This is a simple hangman game based on political geography. After each round, win or lose, the player will get to learn facts about each country and a simple button will link them to wikipedia for further exploration. 

## How to play the Game

Simply press a key on the key board to select your letter. **Make sure your capslock is off!** Only one *special* character is available, which is "-". If you correctly guess all the letters before running out of lives, you win and advance to the next level. If not, you lose and have to start the game again at level 0. 

Play to see if your a real _**Jet-Setter**_.
